testimonials:
  - text: "We have been at Rising Stars for 2.5 years, since my daughter was 5 months old. We love it there. She LOVES school. I love that she is well-cared for, safe and loved. From listening to my wants as far as breast milk and naps went when she was a baby, to taking in my feedback if I'm unsure about anything, the communication with Griselda, the owner/director, has been wonderful. They love children here - & they teach! My kiddo knows all of her numbers, letters, animals, shapes, food, etc in English AND Spanish. They feed them 2 warm meals and a snack. They play outside, make tons of art (even the babies!), have dance parties, play instruments..there's always something fun going on! We actually moved further away from daycare and thought we'd go elsewhere since our commute can be tough - but we love it so much that we decided to stay! The class sizes are small and there's a great community of parents there too. We're so happy we found Rising Stars and can't imagine our girl anywhere else!"

  - text: 'Rising Star is a wonderful loving place for children. I was a caregiver there for 2 months, would have been longer but had to move away for now. Every child there is treated with such loving care and taught so many wonderful things to help them learn and grow. And the communication between parents and teachers is wonderful, especially to see how each one is developing and learning. Being a part of that for me was Great! I will remember and cherish every moment. I would recommend Rising Star with a Five Star. Oh! and Griselda Rocks! She is very thorough, watchful caring and very loving with all the kids / babies.'

  - text: "We have both our boys (16 months) and 3 years enrolled at Rising Stars. It is an AMAZING preschool. I know how difficult it is to search for the perfect place for your children. Rising Stars is truly one of the best. The director/owner, Griselda, and all the wonderful teachers show the kids so much love and warmth everyday. It's hard to leave your children in others hands but this group truly makes it much easier. My oldest comes home singing Spanish songs and talking non stop about the new skills he learns each day. They have low children/teacher ratios, beautiful classrooms, and fantastic pricing which includes breakfast, snack, and lunch. We love Rising Stars and will always be grateful for their help and love in raising our crazy boys."

  - text: "Griselda is such a wonderful caregiver to our boys. She makes them feel so loved. Her learning center is very clean, beautiful, organized, and safe. She sends the parents weekly lesson plans and activities for every age group so we can stay on top of what they're learning. My kids' motor skills, behavior, and vocabulary have greatly improved and their Spanish is very impressive. I totally trust my boys under her care. My oldest is already reading sight words and is very well prepared for transition to Kindergarten. Griselda and her staff are so attentive to the kids and they communicate very well with us. They listen to our concerns and ideas and they handle conflicts so professionally. That makes us feel so good leaving our precious kids in their care."
