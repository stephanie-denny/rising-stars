      Rising Stars has a philosophy of positive guidance, which depends on mutual respect and an understanding of a child’s needs and developmental level. Positive guidance utilizes redirection, verbalization of misunderstandings, consistency, acceptance of feelings, firmness, and fairness. Children are encouraged to express their feelings verbally and discuss and resolve conflicts rather than "act out" their feelings.

      The main reasons for excluding children from the Center are...


      - the illness prevents the child from participating in routine activities;
      - the illness requires more care than the staff can provide without compromising the needs of the other children in the group;
      - the child's presence poses an increased risk to other children or adults with whom the child may come in contact.
      - Children may not attend if they have a temperature of 100 F or higher, a recognizable contagious illness, an undiagnosed rash, vomiting, or uncontrolled diarrhea. Children may return 24 hours after symptoms disappear.
