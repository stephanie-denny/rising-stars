    ## Classroom Overview

    In our infant classrooms, we focus on your baby’s needs and providing a safe
    and consistent environment for your baby to grow and learn. Fundamental to
    your baby’s care is a deep trust in his or her primary caregiver which we
    actively nurture. Our infant classrooms are set up to help your baby feel
    attuned to the caregiver, develop fine and gross motor skills, begin
    language development, and be creative and curious.
