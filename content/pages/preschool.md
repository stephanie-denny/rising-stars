    ## Classroom Overview
    This is such a special time in your child's development when they're expressing more independence through self-help skills and learning to better navigate their world through play, communication, and socialization. Your child is building skills to be a friend. Our goal is to nurture each unique personality in our class and create an environment in which your child feels safe, happy, and secure to be themselves.

      ## Emergent Curriculum

      The whole world is a potential curriculum for your child. Our emergent curriculum approach acknowledges and supports the interests that emerge from the daily life of your child.

      - We believe the value of play is an imperative learning tool for young children.
      - We place emphasis on the day-to-day experience each child gains from doing, rather than how it should be done.
      - Through the use of developmentally appropriate materials, the children’s developing interests will guide the array of topics introduced throughout the school year.

      During a child’s second year, life is full of discovery. We work individually and in community to help children:
      - Increase their independence.
      - Verbalize their needs in a calm manner to both caregivers and peers.
      - Develop confidence in themselves and their abilities.
      - Develop secure relationships with others.
