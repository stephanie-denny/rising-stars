    ## Classroom Overview
    In our Toddlers classrooms, our top priority is to provide a welcoming, trusting, and safe environment for your toddler to explore and learn boundaries with loving guidance from their caregivers. A sense of trust is built between a caregiver and a child naturally. We encourage your child to learn skills independently at their own pace without excessive or unnecessary guidance. We make sure your childâ€™s need for love and growth are met each day.

      - Time for uninterrupted play.
      - Freedom to explore and interact with other children.
      - Involving your child in all care activities to allow your child to become an active participant rather than a passive recipient.
