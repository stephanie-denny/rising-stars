  ## This is a container component

  Your child naturally learns through what he or she encounters in the world. Our teachers create a developmentally appropriate environment for your child to play, create, move, experiment, and express themselves.


  Children are active learners and have opportunities for choice, independence, and learning through hands-on play.


  Activities, materials, and classroom curriculum are selected based on your childâ€™s social, emotional, physical, and congnitive abiltities.
  Your child experiences a balance of indoor and outdoor time, active and quiet play, and individual, small, and large group experiences.

  ##We believe in nurturing the whole child

  Children express a range of emotions as a natural part of their development. We identify and acknowledge these emotions and create opportunities for your child to express them in healthy, constructive ways.


  Children learn how to relate well to others by how they are treated. Teachers treat children, other staff, and parents with respect, kindness, and empathy.


  Children learn how to participate in group activities, get along with peers, and develop trust for adults. We support your child by creating meaningful interactions with others, nurturing friendships, and teaching conflict resolution skills at every age.


  Children develop an enhanced sense of self-esteem and intrinsic motivation through competence and mastery of tasks. Your child grows in independence and self-reliance through routines and activities.
