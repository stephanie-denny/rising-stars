      We have been at Rising Stars for 2.5 years, since my daughter was 5 months
      old. We love it there. She LOVES school. I love that she is well-cared
      for, safe and loved. From listening to my wants as far as breast milk and
      naps went when she was a baby, to taking in my feedback if I'm unsure
      about anything, the communication with Griselda, the owner/director, has
      been wonderful. They love children here - & they teach! My kiddo knows all
      of her numbers, letters, animals, shapes, food, etc in English AND
      Spanish. They feed them 2 warm meals and a snack. They play outside, make
      tons of art (even the babies!), have dance parties, play
      instruments..there's always something fun going on! We actually moved
      further away from daycare and thought we'd go elsewhere since our commute
      can be tough - but we love it so much that we decided to stay! The class
      sizes are small and there's a great community of parents there too. We're
      so happy we found Rising Stars and can't imagine our girl anywhere else!

      Rising Star is a wonderful loving place for children. I was a caregiver
      there for 2 months, would have been longer but had to move away for now.
      Every child there is treated with such loving care and taught so many
      wonderful things to help them learn and grow. And the communication
      between parents and teachers is wonderful, especially to see how each one
      is developing and learning. Being a part of that for me was Great! I will
      remember and cherish every moment. I would recommend Rising Star with a
      Five Star. Oh! and Griselda Rocks! She is very thorough, watchful caring
      and very loving with all the kids / babies.

      We have both our boys (16 months) and 3 years enrolled at Rising Stars. It
      is an AMAZING preschool. I know how difficult it is to search for the
      perfect place for your children. Rising Stars is truly one of the best.
      The director/owner, Griselda, and all the wonderful teachers show the kids
      so much love and warmth everyday. It's hard to leave your children in
      others hands but this group truly makes it much easier. My oldest comes
      home singing Spanish songs and talking non stop about the new skills he
      learns each day. They have low children/teacher ratios, beautiful
      classrooms, and fantastic pricing which includes breakfast, snack, and
      lunch. We love Rising Stars and will always be grateful for their help and
      love in raising our crazy boys.

      Griselda is such a wonderful caregiver to our boys. She makes them feel so
      loved. Her learning center is very clean, beautiful, organized, and safe.
      She sends the parents weekly lesson plans and activities for every age
      group so we can stay on top of what they're learning. My kids' motor
      skills, behavior, and vocabulary have greatly improved and their Spanish
      is very impressive. I totally trust my boys under her care. My oldest is
      already reading sight words and is very well prepared for transition to
      Kindergarten. Griselda and her staff are so attentive to the kids and they
      communicate very well with us. They listen to our concerns and ideas and
      they handle conflicts so professionally. That makes us feel so good
      leaving our precious kids in their care.
